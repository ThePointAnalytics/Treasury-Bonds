Data suggests a clear strategy by the Kenyan government to incentivize investment in infrastructure bonds. Since 2022, consistently higher coupon rates have been offered compared to fixed-rate bonds to compensate for the inherent risks associated with infrastructure projects.
Several factors likely contribute to Kenya's issuance of all-time-high coupon rates. Firstly, a wider budget deficit might have necessitated increased government borrowing. To entice investors to absorb this larger debt issuance, the government offered a more attractive interest rate. Secondly, a potential downgrade in Kenya's credit rating could elevate the perceived risk of these bonds. This, in turn, would likely lead investors to demand a higher return on their investment to justify the additional risk. Finally, broader economic concerns could weaken overall investor appetite for Kenyan bonds. To counteract this, the government raised coupon rates to make these bonds a more compelling investment proposition
